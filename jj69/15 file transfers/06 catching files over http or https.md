## HTTP/S

Web transfer is the most common way most people transfer files because `HTTP`/`HTTPS` are the most common protocols allowed through firewalls. Another immense benefit is that, in many cases, the file will be encrypted in transit. There is nothing worse than being on a Penetration Test, and a client's network IDS picks up on a sensitive file being transferred over plaintext and having them ask why we sent a password to our cloud server without using encryption.

We have already discussed using the Python3 [uploadserver module](https://github.com/Densaugeo/uploadserver) to set up a web server with upload capabilities, but we can also use Apache or Nginx. This section will cover creating a secure web server for file upload operations.

## Nginx - Enabling PUT

A good alternative for transferring files to `Apache` is [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/) because the configuration is less complicated, and the module system does not lead to security issues as `Apache` can.

When allowing `HTTP` uploads, it is critical to be 100% positive that users cannot upload web shells and execute them. `Apache` makes it easy to shoot ourselves in the foot with this, as the `PHP` module loves to execute anything ending in `PHP`. Configuring `Nginx` to use PHP is nowhere near as simple.

#### Create a Directory to Handle Uploaded Files

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/uploads/SecretUploadDirectory
```

#### Change the Owner to www-data

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/uploads/SecretUploadDirectory
```

#### Create Nginx Configuration File

Create the Nginx configuration file by creating the file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/upload.conf` with the contents:

```shell-session
server {
    listen 9001;
    
    location /SecretUploadDirectory/ {
        root    /var/www/uploads;
        dav_methods PUT;
    }
}
```

#### Symlink our Site to the sites-enabled Directory

  ```shell-session

James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/upload.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

#### Start Nginx

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl restart nginx.service
```

If we get any error messages, check `/var/log/nginx/error.log`. If using Pwnbox, we will see port 80 is already in use.

#### Verifying Errors

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ tail -2 `/var/log/nginx/error.log`

2020/11/17 16:11:56 [emerg] 5679#5679: bind() to 0.0.0.0:`80` failed (98: A`ddress already in use`)
2020/11/17 16:11:56 [emerg] 5679#5679: still could not bind()
```

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ ss -lnpt | grep `80`

LISTEN 0      100          0.0.0.0:80        0.0.0.0:*    users:(("python",pid=`2811`,fd=3),("python",pid=2070,fd=3),("python",pid=1968,fd=3),("python",pid=1856,fd=3))
```

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ ps -ef | grep `2811`

user65      2811    1856  0 16:05 ?        00:00:04 `python -m websockify 80 localhost:5901 -D`
root        6720    2226  0 16:14 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto 2811
```

We see there is already a module listening on port 80. To get around this, we can remove the default Nginx configuration, which binds on port 80.

#### Remove NginxDefault Configuration

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Now we can test uploading by using `cURL` to send a `PUT` request. In the below example, we will upload the `/etc/passwd` file to the server and call it users.txt

#### Upload File Using cURL

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]$ curl -T /etc/passwd 
http://localhost:9001/SecretUploadDirectory/users.txt
```

  Upload File Using cURL

```shell-session
James Pearson@htb[/htb]root@localhost# tail -1 /var/www/upload/SecretUploadDirectory/users.txt 

user65:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/user65:/bin/bash
```

Once we have this working, a good test is to ensure the directory listing is not enabled by navigating to `http://localhost/SecretUploadDirectory`. By default, with `Apache`, if we hit a directory without an index file (index.html), it will list all the files. This is bad for our use case of exfilling files because most files are sensitive by nature, and we want to do our best to hide them. Thanks to `Nginx` being minimal, features like that are not enabled by default.
