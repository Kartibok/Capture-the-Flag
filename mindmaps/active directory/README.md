# Mind Mapping Active Directory

This folder contains those AD boxes that I have completed as part of my learning for the PNPT exam from [TCM-Security](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/)

They come from a number of sources that will include TryHackMe and HackTheBox of which some will be free and some subscription only.
