# Mind Mapping Capture the Flag (CTF) Boxes

This folder contains those boxes that I have completed as part of my ongoing cyber red team hobby.

They are based around two main sites:

- [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.com)
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) 

As I subscribe to both sites, the list of boxes will contain free and subscription challenges.

I have been wanting to use mindmapping on boxes for a long time as I am an advocate of the method of learning.

The current application that I am using is EdrawMind.
